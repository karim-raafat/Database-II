# Simple Java DBMS: Milestone 1 🗃️

A Java-based simplified database management system built as part of the **CSEN604 – Databases II** course at the **German University in Cairo**. This project simulates the core operations of a DBMS including table creation, insertion, selection, and trace logging using serialization.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Table Creation**: Define a table with any number of string-based columns.
- **Data Insertion**: Insert records into paged storage, automatically managing new pages when needed.
- **Selection Queries**:  
  - Retrieve all records in a table.  
  - Fetch a specific record by page and index (pointer-based access).  
  - Select records based on column-value conditions (AND logic).
- **Trace Logging**:  
  - Full and last operation trace logging per table.  
  - Execution time tracking for performance insights.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tables and their paginated data are serialized and saved to disk for durability.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java  
- **Serialization**: Java I/O for file-based persistence  
- **IDE**: Visual Studio/ Eclipse
